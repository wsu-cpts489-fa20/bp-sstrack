A.
For our MS3, there is a lot more progress towards our project after meeting with Dr. H.
What has improved and is going well is our team communication, team contribution, and team communication.
This is a great stepping stone as previously we had many issues with the above.

B.
Currently, there are a few things that are not going to well. One of them is getting the project
deployed through AWS. We are having difficulties on getting this part complete. Another issue we
all are facing right now is time managment. We all are having a slight issue trying to contribute 
more to the project, as everyone is having tons of deliverables, exams, and presentations this and next week.

C.
Some ways to help improve these issues is by reaching out to Dr. H and asking for more input on 
deploying the project to AWS. For the time management it is harder to acheive as we are limited
as we are getting towards the end of the semester. What we are plannig is to continue working hard
over the weekend to make more availability next week.
