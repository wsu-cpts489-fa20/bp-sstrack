A. 
For our MS4, we have met during our designated team meetings and helped each other out.
What has improved and is going well is our team communication and team contribution.
This is a great stepping stone as previously we had many issues with the above.

B.
Currently, there are a few things that are not going to well. One of the main issues we are facing
is getting the application deployed to AWS. I have tried many things from the text book, internet, 
and the post that Dr. H mentioned to get AWS deployed. We also had some merge issues and bugs
when viewing a rounds details, so that was left out of the project.
